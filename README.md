# AssemblyAI_transcribe
 This Python script uses the AssemblyAI API to transcribe an audio file to text.

1.Library installation: The script begins by verifying that the assemblyai package is installed. If not, it recommends installing the latest version using pip install -U assemblyai. macOS users might need to use pip3 instead of pip.

2. API configuration: The user must replace the API key with their own (aai.settings.api_key = "your_API_key"), in order to authorize access to the transcription service.

3.Audio File URL: The script takes the URL of an online audio file to perform the transcription. It is also possible to transcribe a local audio file by providing the file path (FILE_URL = './path/to/file.mp3').

4.Transcription: A Transcriber object is created to manage transcription. The audio file is transcribed to text, and the result is stored in the transcript variable.

Error handling: If transcription fails, an error message is displayed. Otherwise, the transcribed text is printed.

This code is a great starting point for anyone looking to automate audio-to-text transcription via AssemblyAI's API.
